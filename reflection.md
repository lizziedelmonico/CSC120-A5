- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
    Association helps me better understand how different classes interact and affect each other in object oriented programming. This was something that I struggled with earlier on in the semester, but I now feel like I have a better understanding of how object oriented programming and the relationships between classes changes the way I program.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This was the assignment where most things that were "squishy" to me finally began to make sense. I was able to complete the majority of this assignment without any help (but eventually needed help from TAs for Train.java). My understanding of general java syntax has improved significantly along with my confidence in my programming.
